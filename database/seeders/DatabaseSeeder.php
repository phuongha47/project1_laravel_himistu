                Further skylights illuminate the hallway, which leads to the home’s four bedrooms, including the primary suite with generous closets and French doors that open out onto the garden.

                The star won't be taking home much of a profit on the sale, considering she paid $1.84 million for the home almost 15 years ago at the end of 2005, according to listing records.
